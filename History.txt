
  Changes for HX OpenWatcom WD

  v1.2 __/2022
  - module stdosfil.obj now included in HXDEV16.
  - no longer any need to change HDPMI environment variable, HDPMI v3.20
    provides an API to change things dynamically.

  v1.1 07/2022

  - wv source added.
  - WD uses VESA functions to save/restore video state.
  - WD page flip directly programs CRT ( BIOS works rather bad in many emulations ).
  - check if current video mode is text has been simplified, since
    the old code has/had problems in DosEmu; works for VGA+VESA only!

  - display/edit XMM registers ( std.trp )
  - screen flip on INT instruction ( madx86.mad )
  - interrupt flag set on program entry ( std.trp )
